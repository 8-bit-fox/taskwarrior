New Features in Taskwarrior 2.5.2

  - The 'QUARTER' virutal tag was added.
  - The 'help' command now takes a 'usage' argument, which displays only the
    command usage.
  - Improved compatibility with SmartOS, OmniOS and OpenIndiana.
  - New DOM references: annotations.count, tw.syncneeded, tw.program, tw.args,
    tw.width, tw.height, tw.version.
  - Renovated 'timesheet' command with a more compact report that accepts a
    filter, and has a default filter showing the last four weeks of completed
    and started tasks.
  - The message telling you to sync now indicates how many local changes will be
    synced.

New Commands in Taskwarrior 2.5.2

  - The 'purge' command was added, which completely removes old tasks.
  - Added new 'history.weekly', 'history.daily', 'ghistory.weekly',
    'ghistory.daily' reports.

New Configuration Options in Taskwarrior 2.5.2

  - New 'relative' column format for 'date' type columns does what 'remaining'
    and 'countdown' do, but in one format.
  - The 'default.scheduled' date/duration works just like 'default.due'.
  - The 'report.timesheet.filter' setting controls the tasks shown by the
    'timesheet' command.

Newly Deprecated Features in Taskwarrior 2.5.2

  - The 'DUETODAY' virtual tag is a synonym for the 'TODAY' virtual tag, and is
    not needed.
  - The 'new-uuid' verbosity option is to be removed, as it is redundant, its
    functionality will be merged with 'new-id' option.
  - The use of alternate Boolean configuration settings is deprecated. Use values
    "0" for off, and "1" for on.  Avoid used of "on", "off", "true", "t",
    "false", "f", "yes", "y", "no", "n".
  - The 'context.program', 'context.args', 'context.width' and 'context.height'
    DOM references are deprecated, replaced by similarly-named 'tw.xxx'
    references.

Removed Features in 2.5.2

  - Removed 'alias._query' default configuration.
  - There is no longer a 16-color default configuration for some platforms,
    making all platforms 256-color.
  - The configuration setting 'burndown.bias' is no longer used.
  - The algorithm used to estimate completion on the 'burndown' reports has
    been replaced by something less icky. Estimates are now based on the net
    completion rate after the peak number of pending tasks.
  - The unused 'dom' and 'shell.prompt' configuration settings were removed.
  - Translations are no longer supported.
